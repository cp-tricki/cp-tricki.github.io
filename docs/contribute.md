## Hearing him chortle, Rita turned toward Byron.
**“You rarely get a laugh from the newspaper these days.**
*What’s so funny?” she asked.*
“A 23-year-old rapper named Roland Pemberton has been
made Poet Laureate of Edmonton.”


“A poet what?”
“A poet laureate celebrates official events by writing
about them.” Byron paused. “This is what Pemberton said
about the job: ‘Poet Laureate—whoa. Getting heavy. Do
I need a staff and a big grey beard?’” Byron chuckled
again. “Rita, you like hip hop music. Ever heard of him
by his stage name— Cadence Weapon?”
“Yeah. Cadence released an album over the Internet, and he has at least two others. He
often raps about Edmonton. His first big hit, ‘Oliver Square,’ is about an Edmonton mall.”
Rita shook her head. “He’s definitely skilled with words, but he’s not someone you’d
expect for that job.”
Byron glanced up from the page. “Pemberton is replacing someone you would expect
in the job—a 74-year-old professor who’s published 29 books and won the Governor
General’s Award for poetry.”
The paper rustled as Byron brought it closer. “But Pemberton’s got a point when he says
‘If people see me as representing Edmonton, maybe it will give them an overall different
perception. I think that’s a positive thing. And it’s getting people talking.’”
“His appointment must have ruffled a few feathers,” said Rita.
“Well, he’s not worried if people are upset. He says he’ll challenge anyone to a poem
battle, ‘a poem-off,’ as he calls it.”
